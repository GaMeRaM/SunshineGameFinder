# Sunshine Game Finder
Searches your computer for various common game install paths for the [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) application. After running it, all games that did not already exist will be added to the `apps.json`, meaning your [Moonlight client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt) should see them next time it is started.

# Running it locally
To run it, open the solution and click "Run" or F5 in Visual Studio
